**CardioImmune Atlas** is a lightweight interactive platform for exploring immune signaling and gene expression patterns in cardiovascular tissues.

### ðŸ”¬ Core Features

- Gene expression visualization (e.g., IL6, TNF)
- Immune cell infiltration estimation (xCell simulation)
- Inflammatory pathway activation mapping (GSEA-style)

### ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run CardioImmune_Atlas_v0_1_full.py
```

Or deploy via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).
